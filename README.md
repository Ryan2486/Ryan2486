# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ryan

> "I was too powerful, so life nerfed me." — but the match isn’t over yet.

## 🧠 About Me

🎓 Master’s student in Software Engineering & Databases at ENI  
💡 Passionate about Artificial Intelligence — not for the buzz, but for the **real** magic behind it  
🛠️ I love to break things down, understand them, and rebuild better. Systems, ideas… even myself.  
🎮 Joker main in Smash Bros (yes, I dodge roll too much), and a bit of a philosopher on the side  
🗣️ "I think so I'm", I like conversations with people who see the bigger picture and ask the real questions

## 🛠️ What I work with

- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript, SQL  
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Next JS, FastAPI  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **Other tools**: Docker, Git, Postman

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LearningPath path = new LearningPath();

        path.append(new PatternNode(Patterns.SINGLETON, "One instance to rule them all."));
        path.append(new PatternNode(Patterns.STRATEGY, "Behavioral flexibility, I choose my weapon."));
        path.append(new PatternNode(Patterns.OBSERVER, "Reactive mind — I see, therefore I respond."));
        path.append(new PatternNode(Patterns.NEURAL_NETWORK, "Imitating the brain. Learning from data."));
        path.append(new PatternNode(Patterns.DEEP_REFLECTION, "Code, like thought, is about structure."));

        path.traverse();
    }
}

    Patterns pattern;
    String message;

public enum Patterns {
    SINGLETON,
    STRATEGY,
    OBSERVER,
    NEURAL_NETWORK,
    DEEP_REFLECTION
}
```

## 💭 What I believe

I believe that **every system has its flaws** — technical or human.  
But that’s what makes it interesting.  
I don’t trust default answers. I trust well-asked questions.  
> Are we coding for performance, or just to avoid waste?  
> Are we building something that works, or something people understand?  
Maybe both. Maybe neither. Maybe it depends.

## ✍️ Random facts

- I keep a journal sometimes — somewhere between philosophy and debugging life  
- I often smile for no reason. Duck mode on. 🦆  
- I ask a thousand questions just to find that one simple, human, universal answer
